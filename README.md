# Cervical_Cancer
## Predict which patients have cervical cancer.

This script pulls in patient data.  Some patients were diagnosed with cervical cancer and others were not.  The 'Biopsy' field is the last field in the dataset & is the target attribute for this model.  To execute, download the repo, install necessary packages, change the active directory, and run the R script.  Enjoy!
